# Random Password Generator

This deployed website is displaying my JavaScript capabilities. It uses some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functioning website that will create a random password for you. It will prompt the user for the length of the password, which needs to be between 8 and 128 characters, and will also confirm whether to use lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters in the password.

If the user does not meet certain requirements while creating the password the website will alert them and they will be able to try again. 
Examples of this would be:
    *Entering a number not between 8 and 128
    *Not using at least 1 modifier - lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters
    *Entering a word for the number of characters to use
